This study conducts an exploratory analysis of Toronto apartment ratings, leveraging open data from the City of Torontoâ€™s datasets spanning 2017 to 2023. The
comprehensive data cleaning process involves variable selection, type conversion,
and handling missing values and outliers. Visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots, provide insights into the dataset. The analysis identifies
significant variables correlated with apartment scores and highlights the potential
impact of property types on ratings. Recommendations for future work include
statistical modeling to assess variable influences on scores and the exploration of
geographical information through maps.
