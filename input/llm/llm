The error you're encountering seems to be related to a file path or permission issue when R is trying to save the plot image. This kind of error can occur in certain R environments, especially those that are part of larger projects or cloud-based setups.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

Check File Permissions: Ensure that your R environment has the necessary permissions to write to the specified directory. This might involve checking the settings in your R environment or speaking with your system administrator.

Specify a Different Save Location: Try specifying a different location to save the plot. You can use ggsave to save the plot to a file in a directory where you have write access.

Plot Directly: If you are working in an interactive environment (like RStudio), try plotting directly to the screen without saving to see if the plot renders correctly.

Here is an example of how you can modify your code to include ggsave:
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming apartment_clean is your data frame and SCORE is a column in it
p <- ggplot(apartment_clean, aes(x = 1, y = SCORE)) +
     geom_boxplot(fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
     labs(title = "Figure 1: Boxplot of Scores", x = "", y = "Score") +
     theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Plotting directly to the screen
print(p)

# Saving the plot to a file
ggsave("boxplot_of_scores.png", plot = p, path = "/your/preferred/directory/", width = 8, height = 6)

To save the plot created by `corrplot` using `ggsave`, you first need to draw the plot in an R graphical device and then save it. `ggsave` is a part of the `ggplot2` package and is typically used for saving ggplot objects, but it can also be used to save other types of plots by capturing the last plot that was drawn.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Create your correlation plot using `corrplot`.
2. Call `ggsave` immediately after to save the plot.

Here's the modified code:

```r
library(corrplot)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming plot_cor is your correlation matrix
plot_cor <- round(plot_cor, digits = 4)

# Creating the correlation plot
Fig_plot <- corrplot(plot_cor, method = "color", tl.cex = 0.7, tl.col = "black")

# Saving the plot using ggsave
# Replace 'path/to/your/directory/' with the actual path where you want to save the plot
ggsave("correlation_plot.png", plot = recordPlot(), path = "path/to/your/directory/", width = 8, height = 6)

Ask:
write a ggsave for this Fig_plot :plot_cor <- round(plot_cor, digits = 4)
class(plot_cor)
Fig_plot <- corrplot(plot_cor, 
                     method = "color", 
                     tl.cex = 0.7, 
                     tl.col = "black")
```

A few points to note:

- `recordPlot()` is used here to capture the last plot drawn. This is useful for saving base R plots or plots from other plotting systems that are not `ggplot` objects.
- Make sure to replace `"path/to/your/directory/"` with the actual path where you want the plot to be saved.
- Adjust the `width` and `height` parameters as per your requirements for the size of the saved plot.

If you encounter any issues with `ggsave`, you can also use traditional base R functions like `png()` and `dev.off()` for saving the plot:

```r
png("path/to/your/directory/correlation_plot.png", width = 800, height = 600)
corrplot(plot_cor, method = "color", tl.cex = 0.7, tl.col = "black")
dev.off()
```

Again, adjust the file path, width, and height as needed.
